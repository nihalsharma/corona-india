                            <a>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</a>
                            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients
                                may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                                symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t
                                develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                                disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                                COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                                those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                                diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                                difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a>How does COVID-19 spread?</a>
                            <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from
                                person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a
                                person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
                                around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or
                                surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if
                                they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
                                This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is
                                sick. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue
                                to
                                share updated findings.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</a>
                            <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who
                                is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very
                                low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                                particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch
                                COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO
                                is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will
                                continue to share updated findings. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</a>
                            <p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.
                                While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases,
                                spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing
                                ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.
                                Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after
                                using the bathroom and before eating. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <a>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</a>
                            <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19
                                outbreak unfolding there.</p>

                            <p>For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However,
                                there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading.
                                For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher.
                                Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of
                                COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel,
                                movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your
                                risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.</p>

                            <p>COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China
                                and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s
                                important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes
                                daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.</p>

                            <a>Should I worry about COVID-19?</a>
                            <p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young
                                adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it
                                need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the
                                COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.

                                We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our
                                communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing
                                and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
                                health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and
                                gatherings. Learn more about how to protect yourself at below link.<a

                            <a>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</a>
                            <p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it
                                seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including
                                preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours
                                or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface,
                                temperature or humidity of the environment).

                                If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the
                                virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub
                                or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>
